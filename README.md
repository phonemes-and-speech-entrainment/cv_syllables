This contains the code used in the analysis of the data in Experiment 2: how different syllable-initial consonants affected entrainment to consonant-vowel syllables. 
The code is in R and Matlab. 
Matlab variables used in the scripts, as well as CSV variables used for R analyses are also posted here. 
The raw EEG data, along with 'ITC_per_stream.mat' and 'Data_fft_all.mat' (used in the scripts here) were uploaded publicly to https://osf.io/3c6tv/.
